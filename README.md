# Hello, I'm Omid! 👋

## About Me
After spending over half a decade in QA, I've pivoted towards the vibrant world of Web Development. My journey through the meticulous realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been fueled by my passion for creating and my desire to build seamless user experiences. Based in Albany, New York, I am eagerly transitioning to front-end development, where I aim to blend my analytical acumen with my newfound coding skills.

## My Journey
•⁠  ⁠*QA Maverick*: With 7+ years in Quality Assurance, I honed my eagle eye for detail and my relentless pursuit of perfection.
•⁠  ⁠*Web Development Aspirant*: Guided by the comprehensive curriculum at TripleTen, I've crafted a solid foundation in web technologies.
•⁠  ⁠*Perpetual Learner*: Transitioning to front-end development isn't just a career move—it's a leap into a lifelong learning adventure.

## My Toolbox
•⁠  ⁠🛠 *Languages*: Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
•⁠  ⁠🎨 *Design*: A flair for UI with a user-centric approach.
•⁠  ⁠🧰 *Tools*: Versed in the latest front-end development tools and best practices.

## My Ethos
I believe in the power of humor to break the ice, the strength of hard work to forge new paths, and the spirit of proactivity to stay ahead of the curve. I am not just in the business of writing code; I am in the business of crafting experiences that resonate, connect, and delight.

## Let's Connect

## Fun Fact
When I'm not debugging code, you might find me debugging the mystery of why my humor often elicits more groans than laughs. But hey, if laughter is the best medicine, consider me a healthcare professional.

Looking forward to bringing a blend of quality and creativity to your team!
